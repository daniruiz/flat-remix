Flat remix is a pretty simple icon theme inspired on material design. It is mostly flat with some shadows, highlights and gradients for some depth and uses a colorful palette with nice contrasts.
<br><br>

<br>
It has been designed on gnome shell 3.24 but it should work with most linux distributions, under gnome, unity, cinammon, xfce, kde, etc.

This theme was made to fit with the [Flat Remix GNOME theme](https://github.com/daniruiz/Super-Flat-Remix-GNOME-theme).
