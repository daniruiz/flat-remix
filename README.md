Super Flat Remix
===========

All icons are available for use under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license. 

Super Flat remix is a pretty simple icon theme, derived from Ultra-Flat-Icons, [Paper](http://snwh.org/paper/), [Flattr](https://nitrux.in/store/flattr-icon-theme/) and [EvoPop](https://github.com/solus-project/evopop-icon-theme) icon themes. Its design is mostly flat with a subtle use of shadows, highlights and gradients for some depth.

It has been designed specially in gnome shell 3.16 but it should work with most linux distributions, under gnome, unity, cinammon, xfce, kde... 

This theme was made to fit with the [Super Flat Remix GNOME theme](http://the-ilife.com/post/130).
