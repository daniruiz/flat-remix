Flat remix is a pretty simple icon theme inspired on material design. It is mostly flat with some shadows, highlights and gradients for some depth and uses a colorful palette with nice contrasts.
<br><br>

<br>
It has been designed on gnome shell 3.26 and ubuntu 17.04 but it should work with most linux distributions, under gnome, unity, cinnammon, xfce, kde, etc.

This theme was made to fit with the [Flat Remix GNOME theme](https://github.com/daniruiz/Flat-Remix-GNOME-theme).
